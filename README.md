# Digital Phantoms - Phishing Detection Project

## Overview

In the digital age, cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, with phishing attacks posing a significant risk to both individuals and organizations. Our project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to offer a comprehensive solution for real-time phishing detection. Developed for HACKATHON-ENSET-2024, themed "AI in Service of Cybersecurity," our solution includes a browser extension, a React-based dashboard, and an Angular-based Progressive Web App (PWA) for broader accessibility.

## Features

- **Real-Time Phishing Detection**: Monitors websites and Gmail inbox for phishing attempts.
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes phishing statistics, and provides URL, email, and vocal phishing checks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy interaction.
- **Adaptability**: Uses machine learning to adapt to new phishing techniques.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Supports URL, email, image (via OCR), and audio analysis.
